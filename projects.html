                            <p>MegPGRAMS is a comprehensive grievance management system developed for the state of Meghalaya, enabling citizens to lodge complaints with various government departments efficiently. The platform streamlines the grievance submission, tracking, and resolution process while ensuring transparency and accountability.</p>
                            <h4>Grievance Submission Process:</h4>
                            <p>Citizens can submit grievances through an intuitive online form, attaching relevant documents and selecting the appropriate department. To ensure authenticity, each submission is secured via an OTP sent to the complainant’s registered mobile number. Once validated, the grievance is formally registered, and an SMS notification with a unique reference number is sent to both the complainant and the respective grievance officer.</p>
                            <h4>Grievance Redressal Workflow:</h4>
                            <ul>

                                <li>If necessary, officials can request additional clarifications or supporting documents from the complainant.</li>
                                <li>If a grievance is deemed irrelevant or false, the department has the option to close it.</li>
                                <li>Complainants can send reminders or follow up on their grievances when required.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Integration and Notifications:</h4>

                                <li>The system is integrated with Sandes, a government-developed instant messaging application, for internal communication.</li>
                                <li>It also supports CPGRAMS (Central Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring System) integration, allowing grievances to be seamlessly transferred between state and central platforms through APIs.</li>

                                <li>Upon resolution, complainants can provide feedback and rate the response. If dissatisfied, they can escalate their grievance to the appellate authority for further review until an acceptable resolution is reached.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Technology Stack:</h4>
                            <p>MegPGRAMS was initially developed using Spring MVC, Java, jQuery, JSP, CSS, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. Later, it was upgraded to Spring Boot for improved performance, scalability, and maintainability.</p>
